## User Story
1. As a software developer, I want to collaborate with other developers on a hobby project so that I can improve my skills and work on something fun and interesting. To achieve this, I will use an app that connects me with other developers who have project ideas that require additional collaborators.

2. When I open the app, I can choose to either post my own project or search for projects to collaborate on. If I choose to post my own project, I can provide a project description, including the skills that I lack and the skills that I need from potential collaborators. I can also add tags to my project, which will help other developers find it when they search for projects.

3. If I choose to search for projects, I can use a search function to filter projects based on the skills that I possess. The app will present me with a list of search results that include projects with the skills that I specified in my search filter selections. I can then view the project descriptions and decide which projects I am interested in collaborating on.

4. Once I have found a project that I want to collaborate on, I can contact the project owner through the app and discuss the project further. The app will provide a platform for communication and collaboration between the project owner and myself, so that we can work together to create a successful project.
